# DeteksiJerawat
An Acne detection system using a simplified VGGNet architecture

## Project Description
A program i made for my Bachelor's Thesis, it is a machine learning model to train to identify different types of acne, using a **Simplified VGG16** (from now will be called **Small VGGNet**) architecture, to analyze on how effective the simplification of architecture to a **Machine Learning** model

this project uses **Tensorflow**, **Keras**, and **Small VGGNet** architecture to build the model, and primarily uses **Computer Vision** and the **Small VGGNet** uses **Convolutional Neural Network**. it will output the inputted image and the possibility of a detected acne
